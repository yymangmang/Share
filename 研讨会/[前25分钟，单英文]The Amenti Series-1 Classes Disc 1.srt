1
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:56,319
Well, everybody knows me, I’m Anna Hayes and I’m your local representative of the Guardian Alliance,

2
00:00:56,412 --> 00:01:05,215
which is a group of beings that come from other dimensional systems,

3
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:08,679
 but also other systems of our 3rd dimension.

4
00:01:08,706 --> 00:01:14,873
Some of them are extra-terrestrial, some of them are meta-terrestrial and some of them are  ultra-terrestrial,

5
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:19,747
which means they’re completely outside of the framework of time and space, as we know it.

6
00:01:19,768 --> 00:01:26,683
It’s a large group that I speak for, and I have been a student of this group since childhood.

7
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:30,593
And, I’m here this evening to share with you some of things that I have learned,

8
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:36,135
and I’m hoping to give you something that you can take home with you, some information that can help you,

9
00:01:36,142 --> 00:01:40,901
perhaps, to understand a little bit better what you’re consciousness is about,

10
00:01:40,908 --> 00:01:46,314
what the experience of other dimensional beings and your relationship to them is about.

11
00:01:46,328 --> 00:01:53,913
And, give you some practical tips on how you can take the knowledge of understanding your bio-energetic system

12
00:01:53,938 --> 00:02:01,359
and use it to begin to accelerate the process of your own evolution, both spiritually and biologically.

13
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:07,550
Now, a lot of people think that spiritual evolution and biological evolution are 2 separate things.

14
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:13,474
 I always thought that, and I think differently now because of what I have been taught by the Guardian Alliance.

15
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:16,656
They introduced me to something called the “Science of Keylonta”.

16
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:19,662
And I first asked them, “what is that?” And they said,

17
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:29,402
 “Well, it can be simply defined as the Science of Light, Sound, the sub-conscious symbol codes and the base codes of matter”.

18
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:34,428
I was like, "Ok, light and sound I understand…these code things, I don’t know what they are at all”.

19
00:02:34,429 --> 00:02:41,184
So, I asked questions and I got many answers, all sorts of things I never really wanted answers to.

20
00:02:41,198 --> 00:02:51,990
But, Keylonta presents a fascinating perspective on the Human mind, on the Cosmos, on matter,

21
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:55,806
anti-matter and the relationship between all of those thing.

22
00:02:55,813 --> 00:02:59,535
And I would like to share with you tonight, some of the information I’ve learned about this Science.

23
00:02:59,535 --> 00:03:02,115
And, hopefully, we can grow in our learning together,

24
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:09,468
because I’m a fellow student of the Guardian Alliance and I have a feeling that our species will be learning this for a very long time.

25
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:14,026
So, we have to start somewhere…Keylonta seems to be the place to start.

26
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,819
All right, I’m going to use some of my notes to help me.

27
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:23,346
Basically, first question is, “What is Keylonta?”  Before everybody looks at this,

28
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:26,563
and there’s people in the group who’ve had a little bit of exposure to this,

29
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,753
and I would like to ask “what is Keylonta,

30
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:33,152
from the information that the people who’ve heard about it have got,

31
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:38,549
who would like to put a little into “what Keylonta, to your understanding right now?”

32
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:42,226
Can you help me?

33
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:49,687
Well, I think it’s basically working with the life force energy of the universe.

34
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:56,662
It’s also consciously working with it and working with the symbols and codes ok,

35
00:03:56,663 --> 00:04:03,860
that help that  Soul accretion process that we talked about.

36
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:14,450
And, it’s done with light and it’s done with sound, and it’s done by activating the chakras, ok, using these technologies.

37
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:22,876
And, you know, it’s not only good to understand it intellectually,

38
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:29,774
but we need to be activating it so we can experience this stuff first hand.

39
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:34,261
So, it’s kind of like, you know, a quick overview of…”

40
00:04:34,268 --> 00:04:38,155
That’s very good, it touches on many of the basics of Keylonta.

41
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:44,626
Is there anybody else that’s read or heard anything about Keylonta that would like to put anything in on that?

42
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:47,756
I know that…

43
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:01,017
 I was going to say that my understanding of Keylonta,

44
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:11,590
where we can use light, color and anything that is electrified, may help heal people in the future.

45
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:21,995
As we have seen some experiences of say, Dr. Robert Becker on growing limbs,

46
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:30,258
which he was successful on frogs after he cut the limb and the limbs grew…provided the electrical potential of the limbs,

47
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:41,068
changed from a positive zero to negative, and that causes the frog limb to grow into a normal, just like the salamander.

48
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:46,587
I believe that in the future, Keylonta, my understanding of Keylonta,

49
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:51,098
will be same line, and being in the field of medicine.

50
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:58,508
They’re going to be very interested in that, especially in trauma surgery, and orthopedics.

51
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:00,933
Keylonta has many, many healing applications.

52
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,688
In fact, in has healing applications across the board,

53
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:08,500
in everything that effects our Universe and our society and our personhood.

54
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:18,295
Because, the real core of Keylonta is it’s a Science of Consciousness and a Science of Creation,

55
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,018
it’s the underlying structures of what matter is created from.

56
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:31,606
It is the underlying structure of consciousness, so it is not something you can learn in one night, by the way (chuckles),

57
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,534
but there are some other things that Keylonta also is.

58
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:40,123
And, I prepared this for both of us, so I can go down the list for myself,

59
00:06:40,148 --> 00:06:44,380
and also you can read along if you like.  It is…

60
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,624
Hold it up higher?

61
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:51,553
Ok, it is the Science of Creation and Consciousness.

62
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:57,103
It’s the Science of macrocosmic and microcosmic interrelationships.

63
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:05,072
It’s the Science of Energy Dynamics through which matter forms and consciousness manifests.

64
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:12,105
It’s the Science of biological, physical and consciousness spiritual evolution.

65
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,701
That’s not all

66
00:07:20,563 --> 00:07:27,315
It is the Science of Humanity’s relationship to its Source and the Cosmos.

67
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:35,523
It is the Science of construction, perception and potentials of the Human organism and consciousness.

68
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:43,137
It is the Science of the structure of multi-dimensional universe and Humanity’s multi-dimensional identity,

69
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:49,437
and Humanity’s relationship to other sentient life forms within the multi-dimensional universe.

70
00:07:49,462 --> 00:07:53,365
Keylonta is all these things and more.

71
00:07:53,956 --> 00:08:00,983
It is the Science of the Human Soul and the Family Tree of Consciousness out of which all of us emerged,

72
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:04,568
which is something not too many scientists know here.

73
00:08:04,593 --> 00:08:11,026
That sounds like something that would be found more so in the realms of religions or churches,

74
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:19,262
but in truth there is not a difference between science and religion, we only perceive it to be, here.

75
00:08:19,287 --> 00:08:30,938
Science does has a Soul that it hasn’t found yet and Keylonta is the place where it can begin to find its Soul.

76
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:41,553
Ok, it is the Science of DNA activation, genetic imprinting, cellular memory and transmutation of form.

77
00:08:41,574 --> 00:08:47,738
Through understanding the dynamics of Keylonta, we can literally change the way our DNA operates.

78
00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:57,628
And DNA governs the structure of our physical body, and our physical body will determine what type of consciousness we are able to bring into our minds,

79
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:05,940
our conscious minds while we’re here.  There’s an intimate connection between Spirit, your spiritual aspect, or your higher dimensional aspects,

80
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:14,440
and consciousness moving through the body.  Because, you can be…you can have a wonderful level of development of consciousness in the higher dimensions,

81
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:20,285
but if you have a neurological structure that is not able to handle the current of all the electrical information,

82
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:22,758
you won’t have access to it on a conscious level.

83
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:28,856
So, the Science of Keylonta gives us tools and understanding of our parts enough,

84
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:32,011
that we can start to expand the potentials of our body,

85
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:34,461
so we can bring in more of our consciousness and awareness,

86
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:39,396
so we can bring in more of our Soul into manifestation, here.

87
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:51,005
Ok, Keylonta is the Science of dimensional ascension, teleportation, bi-location and regeneration of identity.

88
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:55,195
For once you understand how to play with the little particles that you’re composed of,

89
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:02,550
these units of consciousness that Keylonta will teach you about, things like teleportation will come easily to you.

90
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:08,397
You won’t need a machine to do it, because you’ll know how to change the vibrational rate of your molecular structure.

91
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:13,716
Do I know how to do this yet?  No, but I’m first in line as far as wanting to learn.

92
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:17,334
And that’s…we’re getting the foundation of what one day,

93
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:21,718
if we work with these tools, will teach us how to do these things.

94
00:10:21,718 --> 00:10:28,053
There are extra-terrestrial races that are in biologies…they’re not just meta-terrestrials that don’t have bodies any more,

95
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:33,721
they are in bodies…who know this science and who are able to manifest and de-manifest at will.

96
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:40,042
They are able to walk through solid objects, they are able to travel through time with no problem at all,

97
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:47,652
things that seem only science fiction has. It’s because they understand the principles of Keylontic Science.

98
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:51,610
Now, if we get a little more scientific about the whole thing,

99
00:10:51,635 --> 00:10:56,952
Keylontic Science explores the dynamics of time, space and matter…

100
00:10:56,977 --> 00:11:02,644
How those realities of our externalized reality are created.

101
00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:07,710
What are they really?  Where do they come from?  Are they what they appear to be?

102
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:11,292
Some of these questions will be answered through Keylontic Science.

103
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:16,675
We will find that time is not linear, as we perceive it to be; it’s simultaneous in nature.

104
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:22,676
We will find that space all takes place in something called non-space.

105
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:29,558
You’ll find that matter is actually an illusion, a holographic illusion,

106
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:36,592
created by the refraction of energy particles and light and sound frequencies.

107
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:44,466
We will find that things are much different than our 5 senses tell us they are, when we begin to explore Keylonta.

108
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:52,307
Ok, it is the Science of ultra-micro particle and anti-particle dynamics.

109
00:11:52,315 --> 00:11:56,953
It is the Science of 12 Human Senses, not just the 5.

110
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:03,319
And, basically, it is the Science of Light, Sound, Sub-conscious Symbol Codes and the Base Codes of Matter.

111
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,893
And now we’ll learn what they are.

112
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,502
We know light and we know sound, but what are sub-conscious symbol codes?

113
00:12:09,503 --> 00:12:13,886
And, what are base codes of matter?

114
00:12:21,017 --> 00:12:23,403
We’ll skip over this section for a while.

115
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:28,053
This gets into what it can do for us, but I think we’ll get into that at the end.

116
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:35,109
Now, the reason that I’m reading these is because there is a lot of information and...

117
00:12:35,109 --> 00:12:38,954
if I’m just talking to you off the top of my head, I might miss half of it.

118
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:41,145
So, I’m going to read it.  If you can read it, that’s all right,

119
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:43,145
but I don’t think you can because it’s so tiny.

120
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:48,159
But, it’s more so I’m going to read it you so I don’t lose content that way.

121
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:52,346
So, if it gets a little annoying, bear with me, at least you will get the information.

122
00:12:52,353 --> 00:12:57,531
All right, there are 6 Primary Elements in the Science of Keylonta.

123
00:12:57,538 --> 00:13:03,720
The First Element are PartikI…that’s a new word.

124
00:13:03,728 --> 00:13:09,963
PartikI are the smallest units of energy in the Cosmos, according to the Guardian Alliance.

125
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,139
They are electro-tonal units of energy identity...

126
00:13:13,164 --> 00:13:20,007
that emanate from a central Source the Guardian Alliance calls the “Yunasai”.

127
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:23,742
They operate as minute fission/fusion generators.

128
00:13:23,742 --> 00:13:31,810
They create and maintain the electromagnetic frequency fields upon which the universe and all structures built.

129
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:40,024
They exist within and beyond all matter forms, pre-matter, anti-matter and consciousness.

130
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:47,421
They form and sustain something called “Morphogenetic Fields” for all forms, sub-particles, etc.

131
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:49,704
Everything has a Morphogenetic Field.

132
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:54,388
And, a Morphogenetic Field is a basic energy field, energy structure,

133
00:13:54,395 --> 00:13:59,724
behind its manifest form, that allows that manifest form to keep its shape.

134
00:13:59,731 --> 00:14:06,013
And, everything in the universe, every little particle, sub-particle, has one and PartikI is what they are.

135
00:14:06,027 --> 00:14:10,516
Groups of PartikI form larger Morphogenetic Fields, like the ones Humans would have.

136
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:14,250
But even PartikI represents a Morphogenetic Field itself,

137
00:14:14,258 --> 00:14:17,545
so they form…you could look at them, if you wanted to,

138
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:22,397
as little tiny units that are the Morphogenetic Field or form-holding pattern we come out of.

139
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,376
And, we are composed of PartikI; everything is…

140
00:14:26,383 --> 00:14:33,212
the space in the air here is composed of PartikI, our bodies are, our higher consciousness is.

141
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:38,095
PartikI are Unified Energy Field that runs through the entire Cosmos.

142
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:49,545
Ok, let’s go back to here…ok, PartikI are units of electro-tonal consciousness.

143
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:54,008
They are the organizational intelligence within all things.

144
00:14:54,015 --> 00:15:00,350
 In the Spiritual terms, they are the living units of conscious identity and energy,

145
00:15:00,355 --> 00:15:05,471
particles of the consciousness of the Yunasai…which some people call “God”.

146
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:10,814
We are made of these things.  People think God is somewhere out there some place away from us…

147
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:18,571
we are made of the substance of which that Being is, because PartikI are not just energy units,

148
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:22,728
they’re energy identity units; they are conscious.

149
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:27,672
And, they have consciousness that they will group to form different types of consciousness and awareness.

150
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:34,761
They don’t think in terms like we do, but we think because we are composed of them.

151
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:41,787
So, in Spiritual terms, the PartikI are our connection and continual connection to a centralized Source...

152
00:15:41,788 --> 00:15:43,893
that we may call God if we’re comfortable with that.

153
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:48,868
And, if not, the Yunasai works…it’s an energy identity that is a central Source of creation,

154
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,222
and we take place within it.

155
00:15:51,229 --> 00:15:56,012
It’s not out there somewhere; all of reality is taking place within it.

156
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:58,924
And, this is one of the things you’ll learn in Keylonta.

157
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:01,630
You will learn the scientific parts of it, which a lot of spiritual people go,

158
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,820
“oh, that’s not important”…

159
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:06,502
then you’ll learn the spiritual parts of it that a lot of scientific people say,

160
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:09,301
“Oh, that can’t be because spirit’s not real”.

161
00:16:09,307 --> 00:16:12,858
Hopefully, through Keylontic Science, we can learn that, yes,

162
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:18,508
spirituality and our spiritual identity is as real as the identity of our leg or our arm.

163
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:24,612
They are the same substance, they are composed of the same particles, and those particles are PartikI.

164
00:16:24,637 --> 00:16:32,961
Ok, now there are 2 types of sub-particles that are formed from the PartikI.

165
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:38,853
First one, we call Particum, ok, it is a PartikI unit, it’s considered a PartikI,

166
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,875
but the Particum PartikI is slower moving and it contains half of the electro-tonal,

167
00:16:44,883 --> 00:16:50,265
which is electrified sound thrust or force, of its twin.

168
00:16:50,272 --> 00:16:54,319
So, we have Particum and the Particum has a twin.

169
00:16:54,323 --> 00:17:01,830
The Particum moves half as fast, it pulsates half as fast as its twin does.

170
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:12,312
The PartikI is a sub-unit…the Particum is a sub-unit of the PartikI- they make up particles in our universe.

171
00:17:12,325 --> 00:17:18,154
They are the little tiny units that make up our sub-atomic particles in the smallest known particles that we would have,

172
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:23,059
would be composed of Particum PartikI, all right.

173
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:28,094
There is another type of PartikI that are called PartikA.

174
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:34,952
The PartikA are anti-particles to the particles that we are composed of.

175
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:40,105
This implies the existence of a parallel universe,

176
00:17:40,113 --> 00:17:47,794
a parallel self- any form here is a Particum form and it will have its own reflection that moves twice as fast,

177
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:52,650
vibrates twice as fast, in parallel dimensional system, parallel universal system.

178
00:17:52,658 --> 00:17:57,272
We have 15-dimensions in our system and so does the parallel universe.

179
00:17:57,272 --> 00:18:01,955
And, it’s not like they’re way over there some place in another universe far, far away…

180
00:18:01,962 --> 00:18:08,442
these two universes are intimately intertwined, they are taking place in the same space,

181
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:11,935
but on different pulses of consciousness.

182
00:18:11,946 --> 00:18:17,773
So, we perceive one set of pulses over here and we don’t see their set and vice versa.

183
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:24,484
Ok, now, let’s see, PartikI cycle.

184
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,086
The Guardians call this “Cycling”.

185
00:18:27,096 --> 00:18:31,377
The PartikI unit is a unit of electro-tonal thrust that comes out of the Yunasai

186
00:18:31,383 --> 00:18:35,510
because it gets projected into the 15-dimensional system, ok.

187
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,528
When it intersects with the 15-dimensional system,

188
00:18:38,537 --> 00:18:43,995
it under goes fission and it breaks apart and replicates itself.

189
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:55,486
So, it creates…starts out as one, undergoes fission when it hits the frequency bands of the 15-dimensional system and...

190
00:18:55,489 --> 00:19:00,165
then it replicates itself and the original breaks apart, ok.

191
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:08,600
So, now the original pattern of that tone remains in the replication, so it’s never gone, ok.

192
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:12,948
The one that broke up first, the replicable is the original pattern,

193
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:15,983
the one that came first breaks up into 2 pieces,

194
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:20,256
the Particum and the PartikA- they are created at the same time,

195
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:25,943
ok, they flash on, one in our universe and one in the parallel universe.

196
00:19:25,949 --> 00:19:30,996
And, our particles…we’re made of an infinite number of them compose our bodies,

197
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:34,976
but this is what they are doing so fast that we can’t perceive it.

198
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:38,695
So, they break up into the PartikA and the Particum,

199
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:43,185
they manifest into the dimensional fields and then because this one,

200
00:19:43,186 --> 00:19:47,768
the PartikA has twice the amount of thrust or force,

201
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:53,405
and it’s moving away from the morphogenetic field just like this one is,

202
00:19:53,416 --> 00:20:00,547
it starts to tow the Particum- it makes it spin reverse direction and go back to fuse with the morphogenetic field.

203
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:07,158
So, the Particum particle here flashes off in our universe and it goes back into the morphogenetic field,

204
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:10,470
it expands the morphogenetic field, adding to it,

205
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:14,369
then this becomes more of a thrust than what the PartikA is.

206
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:16,950
So, it pulls the PartikA, makes it spin,

207
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:25,999
pulls the PartikA anti-particle back in and it fuses with the Particum particle inside of the morphogenetic field.

208
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:32,480
Now, both our particle and our anti-particle have both flashed off, we have disappeared momentarily.

209
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:37,374
Then, this act, as they fuse, it creates…

210
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,484
as we know when something fuses it releases a burst of energy,

211
00:20:40,492 --> 00:20:43,292
it sends a quarter of its thrust back toward the Yunasai,

212
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:45,166
creating something called a “backflow”,

213
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:50,222
which is a current that pulls away from the dimensional matrix that we’re in ok.

214
00:20:50,227 --> 00:20:54,694
So, it would be the current that would take us back home to God, if you want to look at it that way.

215
00:20:54,719 --> 00:21:03,768
When it creates the backflow, that sets off another act of fission within the morphogenetic field and again,

216
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:09,174
the ones that had come together will start to cycle again and it’ll do this again, and they’ll break apart again.

217
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:14,786
So, they’re constantly flashing on together, then the particle flashes off, the anti-particle flashes off,

218
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:17,927
they replicate, create a backflow and flash on again.

219
00:21:17,938 --> 00:21:20,863
And, this is happening so fast, I believe the particles…

220
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:26,899
what …I believe it was 3/100ths of second in the 3rd dimensional particles...

221
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:30,374
and some of them are much, much faster than that in the higher dimensional fields.

222
00:21:30,382 --> 00:21:32,608
So, we are composed of these structures.

223
00:21:32,614 --> 00:21:38,014
Most of us have no idea we’re composed of these structures and most of us don’t know that we flash on and off.

224
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:41,394
Where do we go in between these flashes, was my first question.

225
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,196
If I’m flashing on and off and it’s happening,

226
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:48,071
you know, too fast for my senses to see, where am I going?

227
00:21:48,082 --> 00:21:51,649
You know, when I de-manifest am I gone or what?

228
00:21:51,674 --> 00:21:57,141
No, we return to our original pattern, the morphogenetic field out of which we came,

229
00:21:57,145 --> 00:22:03,571
our original identity that has all of our parts in it and all possible versions of our parts.

230
00:22:03,596 --> 00:22:06,234
Our…all right, in the 15-dimensional Matrix…

231
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:10,918
which we’re not going to go into it too heavily this time or I’ll never get to the end of what I want to get into,

232
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:17,036
but the morphogenetic field for the particles that make up say, our bodies, these are d-1 particles,

233
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:22,760
1st dimensional particles, they would have their morphogenetic field in d-15.

234
00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:26,665
Our, what we call our “emotional bodies”, or, it’s actually our “elemental body”,

235
00:22:26,671 --> 00:22:30,859
the complex elements that form the matter in our bodies, that help to form it,

236
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:36,215
that is our 2nd dimensional aspect of PartikI, or Particum in our universe.

237
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:43,087
The morphogenetic field for that is in d-14, so there is a correlation 
between the levels of our...

238
00:22:43,103 --> 00:22:47,733
our PartikI here and where our morphogenetic field is in the higher dimensions.

239
00:22:47,744 --> 00:22:49,108
And, we’ll get into that in another little one.

240
00:22:49,112 --> 00:22:54,327
But, it’s enough to know that we’re made of these things, that most people don’t even know exist yet.

241
00:22:54,332 --> 00:23:02,785
And, they hold the key to our consciousness and our perception of matter, space and time.

242
00:23:06,464 --> 00:23:12,065
The 2nd Primary Element of Keylontic Science is a PartikI grid,

243
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:17,154
and this brings it a little bit home, brings it down to where we can understand it a little bit more.

244
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,590
It’s something that we have and it’s a grid, ok. A PartikI grid is composed of PartikI units.

245
00:23:22,592 --> 00:23:27,127
In our system there is a Particum grid, it’s made of the Particum particles.

246
00:23:27,135 --> 00:23:30,820
In the parallel universe it’s a PartikA grid.

247
00:23:30,825 --> 00:23:39,512
But, what the PartikI grid, whichever side it’s on, is…it’s a grouping of PartikI.

248
00:23:39,514 --> 00:23:41,961
PartikI group by like polarization.

249
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:48,236
That means Particum will group together and PartikA will group together to form more complex structures.

250
00:23:48,247 --> 00:23:50,906
The first thing they’ll form are strands.

251
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:53,730
They form strands of electro-tonal energy units.

252
00:23:53,731 --> 00:23:57,426
Those strands group to form grids.

253
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:02,398
If you take strands and cross them this way and this way and this way, you get what looks like a little carpet of light.

254
00:24:02,423 --> 00:24:10,853
it’s made of little fibers of light and that is the Unified Field of Energy that exists within everything and through everything,

255
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,497
and connects us directly into our Source of which we emerge.

256
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,603
It connects us directly to the Yunasai. It connects us to each other, ok.

257
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:23,411
So, the PartikI grid is simply…you can look at it as a carpet of light and sound.

258
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:30,162
It’s invisible to our perceptions, but it exists beneath all matter forms and all forms of consciousness.

259
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:39,600
Ok, let’s see, ok, here we have the Cosmos represents a massive PartikI grid,

260
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:46,437
which serves as the Unified Field of Energy Substance within which all things exist and are interconnected.

261
00:24:46,438 --> 00:24:49,833
All beings and matter forms have personal PartikI grids,

262
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,279
which are formed within the grid of the Unified Field.

263
00:24:53,304 --> 00:24:58,989
Energy and Identity perpetually circulate from the Yunasai into the dimensional systems and...

264
00:24:58,995 --> 00:25:04,595
back again through the electromagnetic fabric of the PartikI grids.
